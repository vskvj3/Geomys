## Commands
### ECHO
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'ECHO', 'message': 'hello'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'message': 'hello'}   
```

### SET
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'SET', 'key': 'story', 'value': 'quick fox jumps over a lazy dog'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK'}
```

### GET
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'GET', 'key': 'story'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'value': 'quick fox jumps over a lazy dog'}
```

### INCR
- Only applicable to integer counters.

**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'INCR', 'key': 'counter', 'offset': '1'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'value': 2}
```

- INCR only supports integers up to 2<sup>63</sup>. Updating beyond that point is undefined.

## Data Types
There are some data types we are planning to integrate into the key-value store.

### Strings
- The primary and default data type will be strings.
```bash
>> set name john
>> get name
Server: john
```
- Multi-word strings can be used with double quotes.

> [!WARNING]
> Double quotes are not escaped in strings, so be careful.
```bash
>> set name "john doe"
>> get name
Server: john doe
```
- In API specification, strings are handled in MessagePack as shown below:
```go
map[command:SET key:name value:"john doe"]
```
- Implementing multi-word strings is the responsibility of the client-side, as the server will handle strings of any length for both keys and values.

### Counters
- Counters are a special type of value that can only increase over time.
```bash
>> set value_count 1
Server: OK
>> incr value_count 1
Server: 2
>> incr value_count 1
Server: 3
```
**INCR command implementation:**
```go
map[command:INCR key:value_count offset:1]
```
- The server returns a MessagePack object with `value` set to the new value upon completion.

### Stack and Queue
- Both stack and queue functionalities are implemented within the same structure.
- The single structure is called **LIST** and supports the following operations:
    - **PUSH**: Inserts an element into an existing list, or creates a new list if it does not exist.
    - **RPOP**: Removes and returns the last element of the list.
    - **LPOP**: Removes and returns the first element of the list.
- All these commands are non-blocking and return `STATUS: ERROR` upon unsuccessful execution.
```python
req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '1'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '2'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '3'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'LPOP', 'key': 'test-stack'}
res: {'status': 'OK', 'value': '1'}

req: {'command': 'RPOP', 'key': 'test-stack'}
res: {'status': 'OK', 'value': '3'}
```

### Internal Implementation of Stack/Queue
- Since both stack and queue are developed within a single structure, it will function similarly to a **deque**.
- The application should be optimized for:
    - Insert at front: **O(1)**
    - Insert at rear: **O(1)**
    - Delete from front: **O(1)**
    - Delete from rear: **O(1)**

## Collision Behavior
This section explains the behavior of the basic **SET** command:
- If the key **already exists**:
    - Returns an error.
- If the key **does not exist**:
    - Creates a new key and stores the value.

## Persistence
### Storage Methods
1. **Write-Through Disk**
2. **Buffered Writes**

- Persisted databases are stored by default at `HOME:/.geomys/persistence.db`.
- Commands are stored after binary encoding.

### Write-Through Disk
- Every write operation to the cache is immediately written to persistent storage.
- It has significant write overhead.
- Highest I/O overhead and slower command execution.
- More reliable than **Buffered Writes**.
- Commands are stored in an **append-only file**, which is replayed upon server restart to restore the database.

### Buffered Writes
- Faster command execution.
- Data is grouped into batches and written at regular intervals.
- Data loss may occur if a failure happens before the last write.
- Preferable when some data loss is acceptable, and lower latency is required.

> Both persistence methods currently use an **append-only file** to store data.
- Only **one persistence mechanism** can be active at a time.
- By default, **no persistence is enabled**; it must be activated via a config file.

## High Availability Architecture
The system follows a **Leader-Follower** architecture.

#### Leader
A leader is responsible for following tasks:
- Writes: 
    - Leader is the only allowed node in the cluster to write.
    - All the other nodes redirects writes to the leader.
- House keeping:
    - Leader keeps track of the existing nodes in the cluster, and checks which of the nodes are alive by using a heartbeat mechanism. 
    - This heartbeat also contains a list of existing nodes in the system and a hash of the list. 
    - The list of the nodes will help the other nodes to keep track of the existing nodes.
    

### Leader Election
- Initially, the **first node to start** becomes the **default leader** (highest ID).
- Followers send **heartbeats every 5 seconds** to the leader.
- If the leader does not respond to **3 consecutive pings** (15 seconds timeout), a new leader is elected.
- The **node with the highest ID** becomes the new leader, and replication resumes.

### Request Handling
- **Write Requests**: Routed to the leader â†’ Replicated to followers.
- **Read Requests**: Can be handled by any node (leader or follower).

### Node Failures
- If a **replica fails**, it recovers by fetching the latest state from the leader.
- Heartbeat mechanism detects node failures (every 5 seconds).
- If a node is unresponsive for **15 seconds**, it is marked as failed.

### Cluster Management
- **Bootstrap Mode**: Start as a leader if no existing cluster.
- **Join Mode**: Connect to an existing leader.
- **Standalone Mode**: Operate independently without clustering.

## Upcoming Considerations
### Blocking & Non-Blocking Commands
> In Redis, some commands block execution until a condition is met.
> For example, **BLPOP** blocks the client until an element is available in the list.
> - It can take a **timeout** value specifying when blocking ends.
> - See [Redis BLPOP documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/blpop/) for reference.
