## Commands
### ECHO
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'ECHO', 'message': 'hello'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'message': 'hello'}   
```

### SET
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'SET', 'key': 'story', 'value': 'quick fox jumps over a lazy dog'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK'}
```

### GET
**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'GET', 'key': 'story'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'value': 'quick fox jumps over a lazy dog'}
```

### INCR
- Only applicable to integer counters.

**Request:**
```python
{'command': 'INCR', 'key': 'counter', 'offset': '1'}
```
**Response:**
```python
{'status': 'OK', 'value': 2}
```

- INCR only supports integers up to 2<sup>63</sup>. Updating beyond that point is undefined.

## Data Types
There are some data types we are planning to integrate into the key-value store.

### Strings
- The primary and default data type will be strings.
```bash
>> set name john
>> get name
Server: john
```
- Multi-word strings can be used with double quotes.

> [!WARNING]
> Double quotes are not escaped in strings, so be careful.
```bash
>> set name "john doe"
>> get name
Server: john doe
```
- In API specification, strings are handled in MessagePack as shown below:
```go
map[command:SET key:name value:"john doe"]
```
- Implementing multi-word strings is the responsibility of the client-side, as the server will handle strings of any length for both keys and values.

### Counters
- Counters are a special type of value that can only increase over time.
```bash
>> set value_count 1
Server: OK
>> incr value_count 1
Server: 2
>> incr value_count 1
Server: 3
```
**INCR command implementation:**
```go
map[command:INCR key:value_count offset:1]
```
- The server returns a MessagePack object with `value` set to the new value upon completion.

### Stack and Queue
- Both stack and queue functionalities are implemented within the same structure.
- The single structure is called **LIST** and supports the following operations:
    - **PUSH**: Inserts an element into an existing list, or creates a new list if it does not exist.
    - **RPOP**: Removes and returns the last element of the list.
    - **LPOP**: Removes and returns the first element of the list.
- All these commands are non-blocking and return `STATUS: ERROR` upon unsuccessful execution.
```python
req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '1'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '2'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'PUSH', 'key': 'test-stack', 'value': '3'}
res: {'status': 'OK'}

req: {'command': 'LPOP', 'key': 'test-stack'}
res: {'status': 'OK', 'value': '1'}

req: {'command': 'RPOP', 'key': 'test-stack'}
res: {'status': 'OK', 'value': '3'}
```

### Internal Implementation of Stack/Queue
- Since both stack and queue are developed within a single structure, it will function similarly to a **deque**.
- The application should be optimized for:
    - Insert at front: **O(1)**
    - Insert at rear: **O(1)**
    - Delete from front: **O(1)**
    - Delete from rear: **O(1)**

## Collision Behavior
This section explains the behavior of the basic **SET** command:
- If the key **already exists**:
    - Nothing happens, rewrites the value.

## Persistence
- Persisted data is used to regenerate database when the system restarts.
### Write-Through Disk
- Persisted databases are stored by default at `HOME:/.geomys/<node_id>/binlog.dat`.
-  Every write operation (`SET`, `PUSH`, `INCR`, etc.) is **logged in a structured binary format**.
- Every write operation to the cache is immediately written to persistent storage.
- If enabled, it has significant write overhead.
- Highest I/O overhead and slower command execution.
- Commands are stored in an **append-only file**, which is replayed upon server restart to restore the database.

### How data is encoded?
#### Binary Log Structure
Each command is stored in the following **binary format**:
| Field        | Size (bytes)    | Description  |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Command Length | 4  | Length of the command string (e.g., `"SET"`). |
| Command | Variable | The actual command (e.g., `"SET"`). |
| Key Length | 4 | Length of the key string. |
| Key | Variable | The actual key (e.g., `"mykey"`). |
| Value Length | 4 | Length of the value string (if present). |
| Value | Variable | The actual value (e.g., `"hello"`). |
| Offset Length | 4 | Length of the offset string (if present). |
| Offset | Variable | The actual offset value (if applicable). |
| End Marker | 4 | `"EOF\0"` (hex: `0x45, 0x4F, 0x46, 0x00`) marks the end of a command entry. |

Consider the following command being stored:
```json
{
  "Command": "SET",
  "Key": "mykey",
  "Value": "hello"
}
```
It will be stored in binary format as:

| Field | Binary Representation |
|--------|----------------------|
| Command Length | `0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00` (3 bytes: `"SET"`) |
| Command | `"SET"` (`0x53 0x45 0x54`) |
| Key Length | `0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00` (5 bytes: `"mykey"`) |
| Key | `"mykey"` (`0x6D 0x79 0x6B 0x65 0x79`) |
| Value Length | `0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00` (5 bytes: `"hello"`) |
| Value | `"hello"` (`0x68 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F`) |
| Offset Length | `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00` (0 bytes, since offset is not provided) |
| End Marker | `0x45 0x4F 0x46 0x00` (`"EOF\0"`) |

- Which will result in the following hex dump:
```mathematica
03 00 00 00  53 45 54  
05 00 00 00  6D 79 6B 65 79  
05 00 00 00  68 65 6C 6C 6F  
00 00 00 00  
45 4F 46 00
```

- When the server restarts, it reads and reconstructs the stored commands from `binlog.dat` using `LoadRequests()`, replaying each operation to restore the last known state.


## High Availability Architecture
The system follows a **Leader-Follower** architecture.

#### Leader
A leader is responsible for following tasks:
- Writes: 
    - Leader is the only allowed node in the cluster to write.
    - All the other nodes redirects writes to the leader.
- House keeping:
    - Leader keeps track of the existing nodes in the cluster, and checks which of the nodes are alive by using a heartbeat mechanism. 
    - This heartbeat also contains a list of existing nodes in the system and a hash of the list. 
    - The list of the nodes will help the other nodes to keep track of the existing nodes.
    

### Leader Election
- Initially, the **node started in bootstrap mode** becomes the **default leader** (highest ID).
- Followers send **heartbeats every 5 seconds** to the leader.
- If the leader does not respond within **15 seconds**, a new leader election procedure begins.
- The **node with the highest ID** becomes the new leader, and replication resumes.

### Request Handling
- **Write Requests**: Routed to the leader â†’ Replicated to followers.
- **Read Requests**: Can be handled by any node (leader or follower).

### Node Failures
- If a **replica fails**, it can recover by fetching the latest state from the leader(by restarting and rejoining the cluster).
- Heartbeat mechanism detects node failures (every 5 seconds).
- If a node is unresponsive for **15 seconds**, it is marked as failed.

### Cluster Management
- **Bootstrap Mode**: Start as a leader if no existing cluster if bootstrap flag is given when starting the server.
- **Join Mode**: Connect to an existing leader.
- **Standalone Mode**: Operate independently without clustering.

#### How cluster mode should look like?
- Stariting leader:
```bash
geomys -node_id=6767 -port=6767 -bootstrap
```
port 6767 will be used for the main server to run(which is used for clients to connect to run queries), main port + 1000 (7767) will be used for the grpc server, which will be used to distribute data and replications
- if no port flag, and node_id flag is given, they will be assigned automatically

- Starting follower and joining leader
```bash
geomys -node_id=6767 -port=6797 -join=127.0.0.1:7767
```

The follower will connect to leader on port 7767(grpc port), if leader is found working on this port, it must return an error

- Once we add multiple followers to join the cluster, then the cluster management will become more automatic(if the existing leader fails, next available follower will become leader after an election)

- If a follower fails, it fails. A maintainer can manually start up a new node to join an existing leader and it will work. The follower will not try to start up again, there is not point in that.
- Same goes for the leader node, if it completely fails, there is no point in starting it again. since it is gone, a new follower will take its job, if we want to scale again, create a new follower to join the existsing cluster.

## Leader election:
- Each follower will send heartbeat to the leader.
- Leader will send the updated nodes list as a response to the heartbeat(so each node will have an updated nodes list).
- When leader goes down(does not reply to heartbeat within 15 seconds), a new election begins.
- Each node will send a VoteRequest to all the nodes in its nodes list.
- Upon recieving this request, the nodes will check the smalllest node id in its list and send it back. 
- If a node receives same node id from all the votes, it will be selected as the new leader.
- If the nodes cannot agree on the leader, node list is updated, and a new election begins.
- Upon electing a leader, a heartbeat is send to the new leader as a indication of whether the leader is alive, if the leader is alive, nodes will connect to the new leader, if the leader  is not alive, the node is removed from the nodes list and a new leader election begins again.

## Upcoming Considerations
### Blocking & Non-Blocking Commands
In Redis, some commands block execution until a condition is met.
For example, **BLPOP** blocks the client until an element is available in the list.
- It can take a **timeout** value specifying when blocking ends.
- See [Redis BLPOP documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/blpop/) for reference.
### Safe set
- Set command that will send as error if the key already exists.
- Is this meant to be an atomic compare-and-swap (SETNX equivalent).
